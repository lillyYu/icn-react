        <h2>Career Goals</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            My career goal in life is to break into the realm of investment banking and eventually reach the position of Managing Director at a bulge bracket bank. As a half-Pakistani, half-caucasian woman who has lived in New York, Beijing, and London, I believe I can offer my diverse background to help reshape the field of finance, transitioning it from a “male-dominated” field to an inclusive space in which women can excel. After graduating from Harvard, I will be joining an investment bank in New York City as a full-time analyst in the Financial Sponsors Group.

        <h2>Work experience</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            This past summer, I interned at an investment bank in their Financial Sponsors Group. Aside from undergoing several weeks of technical training, I conducted an individual case study on a wholesale club and developed an investment thesis for the food retailer supported by several financial models. In the summer of 2019, I was a business analyst at a financial-technology consulting firm in New York City called Proviniti, where I implemented a data migration plan and assisted with project management efforts for the merger between Fiserv and First Data in an all-stock transaction valued at $22 billion. The summer prior to that (and the following Fall semester of my sophomore year), I was the New Initiatives Manager at Harvard Student Agencies Tutoring, the largest student-run company in the world with more than 650 student-employees from Harvard College. My role entailed planning college application bootcamps around the United States and organizing/hosting our first ever Women’s Leadership Conference. During the school term I also worked for Strategy at Harvard Student Agencies, the internal consulting department, where I conducted market research and delivered strategic proposals regarding business development opportunities for the company. Recently I have been promoted to the Chair of the Blog for The Harvard Crimson, which is Harvard University’s student-run newspaper. I am responsible for editing, proofing, and publishing at least one article per day for our online blog called Flyby. My co-Chair and I also have the task of planning, editing, and publishing our most popular annual features such as The Housing Market, a series that receives over 15,000 page views annually.
